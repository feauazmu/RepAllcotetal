            column 2 are inferred from a Pew Research Center (2018f) survey of 
            social media use by demographic group. The bottom number in column 2 
            (the average of 45 minutes of Facebook use per day) is approximated 
            on those basis of sources such as Facebook (2016) and Molla and 
            Wagner (2018). Column 3 presents average demographics of American 
            adults. The top five numbers are from the 2017 American Community 
            Survey (US Census Bureau 2017), and the Republican and Democrat 
            shares are from the 2016 American National Election Study (American

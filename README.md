# Replication of Alcott et al. (2020)

In this repository you can find the code with which I try to replicate the
results obtained by:

[Allcott, H., Braghieri, L., Eichmeyer, S., & Gentzkow, M. (2020). The welfare effects of social media. *American Economic Review, 110(3)*, 629-76.](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190658)

The final product of the replication exercise is the jupyter notebook hosted here.   For its proper reproduction, the following services can be used:

## Replication of Allcott et al. (2020)
  
Allcott et al. (2020) conducted a large experimental study in which they estimate the effects of deactivating Facebook on a variety of outcomes.  To achieve this goal, the authors asked a group of users to deactivate Facebook for 4 weeks and estimated the local average treatment effects.  The authors found that deactivation had a significant effect on several outcomes.  
  
Using the data the authors collected, which is publicly available, I have tried to replicate the results outlined in the original article.

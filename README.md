# Replication of Alcott et al. (2020)

In this repository you can find the code with which I try to replicate the
results obtained by:

[Allcott, H., Braghieri, L., Eichmeyer, S., & Gentzkow, M. (2020). The welfare effects of social media. *American Economic Review, 110(3)*, 629-76.](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190658)

The final product of the replication exercise is the jupyter notebook hosted here. Some tables may not be displayed properly on github.  Please use one of the following services for its proper reproduction:

## Replication of Allcott et al. (2020)
  
Allcott et al. (2020) conducted a large experimental study in which they estimate the effects of deactivating Facebook on a variety of outcomes.  To achieve this goal, the authors asked a group of users to deactivate Facebook for 4 weeks and estimated the local average treatment effects.  The authors found that deactivation had a significant effect on several outcomes.  
  
Using the data the authors collected, which is publicly available, I have tried to replicate the results outlined in the original article.
